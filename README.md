##  Scattering for Image Recognition

Scattering transforms build invariant, stable and informative representations through a non-linear, unitary transform, which delocalizes signal information into scattering decomposition paths. They are computed with a cascade of wavelet modulus operators, and correspond to a convolutional network where filter coefficients are given by a wavelet operator.
